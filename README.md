# Iterator Pattern

The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation. It defines a way to sequentially access the elements of an aggregate object (like a list, array, tree, etc.) without the need to understand its underlying structure.

## Purpose

- **Separation of Concerns**: It separates the process of accessing elements from the underlying data structure, promoting a clean separation between algorithms and data structures.
  
- **Standardized Access**: It provides a standard interface for accessing elements of various collections, making the client code independent of the collection's specific implementation.

- **Supports Iteration**: Allows iterating over elements of an aggregate object sequentially, providing methods to move through the elements.

## Components

### Iterator
- Provides an interface for accessing and traversing elements within a collection.
- Contains methods like `hasNext()`, `next()`, etc., allowing clients to access elements sequentially.

### Aggregate
- Defines an interface for creating an Iterator object.
- Typically represents a collection of objects and provides a method to create an Iterator.

### Concrete Iterator
- Implements the Iterator interface.
- Maintains the current position in the collection and provides methods to move to the next element, retrieve the current element, etc.

### Concrete Aggregate
- Implements the Aggregate interface.
- Creates a Concrete Iterator and provides methods to retrieve or modify elements in the collection.

## How It Works

1. **Iterator Creation**: The client requests an Iterator from the Aggregate object.
2. **Iteration**: The client uses the Iterator to access elements sequentially using methods like `hasNext()` and `next()`.
3. **Accessing Elements**: The client accesses elements without needing to know the collection's internal structure, simplifying the code.

## Usage

- **When you want to traverse elements in a collection without exposing its internal structure.**
- **When you need to access elements of a collection in a standardized way without knowing the specific implementation.**

## Example

For example code and implementation details, refer to the code snippets and explanations in this repository's code directory.

## Implementation Notes

- Consider implementing custom iterators to iterate over complex data structures efficiently.
- Ensure that the Iterator and Aggregate interfaces are well-defined to support various types of collections.
